## Objectives

### Generals

* Establish the theoretical basis that allows the deduction of a dynamic methodology for the development of information systems based on conceptual principles of the general theory of development systems and methodologies that are currently used.
* Have a practical experience in the use of the knowledge acquired in theory by applying a work methodology in solving a real case.

### Specifics

* Identify the basic concepts of general systems theory.
* Understand information systems. Its categorization and its role within organizations.
* Establish differences between the different methodologies of information system development, (oriented to function, data, objects, etc.).
* Learn in detail the methodologies for developing systems most frequently used.
* Apply them conveniently in solving a problem or real-life case.
