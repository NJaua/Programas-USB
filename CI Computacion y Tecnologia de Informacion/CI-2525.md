## Objectives

* Introduction of useful mathematical tools for modeling and analyzing discrete phenomena or processes.
* Introduction to a discrete theory analogous to differential and integral calculus.

## Topics

* 1st Class: Objectives of the combinatorics. Fundamental principles of counting. Interpretation of functions as a sequence and as assignments to boxes. Cardinality of all the functions of a set A to a set B (finite). Number of injective functions (applications of counting principles).
* 2nd Class: Application of fundamental counting principles: place objects of a set X in m boxes, objects in boxes must be ordered (discuss various methods). Strictly increasing tuples in the alphabet 1, ..., n, number of m-subsets of an n-set. Number of increasing m-words in an n-alphabet.
* 3rd Class: Number of ordered and generalized n-partitions of m (two methods). Consequences: Number of increasing and strictly increasing functions. Principles of inequality or Pigeon Hole.
* 4th Class: Binomial and multinomial coefficient. Properties Sums and products. Operations on sums.
* 5th Class: Binomial and multinomial theorem. Principle of inclusion-exclusion.
* 6th Class: Applications of inclusion-exclusion type: numbers of bijective functions and partitions of a set in m classes. Sets of objects that satisfy exactly certain properties. Derangements.
* 7th Class: Recurrence equations. Formulation Examples Direct Resolution and Combination methods.
* 8th Class: Linear recurrence equations with constant coefficients. Resolution Method.
* 9th Class: Resolution by generating functions. Equation and resolution to parentize an expression.
* 10th Class: Calculation of differences. Similarity with differential calculation. Differences of a polynomial.
* 11th Class: Properties of the operator difference. Factorial functions. Stirling numbers of the first order.
* 12th Class: Second order Stirling numbers. Combinatorial interpretation. Difference of special functions.
