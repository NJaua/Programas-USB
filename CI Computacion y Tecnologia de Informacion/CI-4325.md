## Objectives

### General

Transmit to the student the most appropriate approach under which to perceive, design, create and evaluate the interfaces.

### Specifics

Allow the student to understand the area of human-machine interaction and see the discipline from the point of view of the technology of the I/O devices, the ergonomics of these devices, the design methods and development of interaction software, the psychology of the programming, the users of the application systems and the modeling and measurements of the human-machine interaction.

## Topics

* Introduction. The history computer interfaces, texts and fundamental authors: Vannevar Busch, J.C.R. Licklider, Doug Engerbart, Ted Nelson, Ivan Stherland, Alan Kay, Nicholas Negroponte, etc. Importance of Interfaces.
* Importance of interface design in the software life cycle.
* Presentation of the I/O devices, its ergonomics functionality.
* Knowledge of the three main channels of communication: the visual channel, the auditory channel and the gestural channel.
* Methods of design and creation of Interfaces.
* Methods of evaluation of Interfaces.
* Presentation of some commercial interface systems: Windows, Macintosh toolbox, Mac App, etc.
* Design and creation of an interface. For example: a system of interaction with icons, a system of design and management of menus. Formalization and realization of an interaction metaphor, etc.
* Multimedia systems: the concepts of hypertext and electronic book. The video on the screen, videos DVI, CDI and CDXA.D.
